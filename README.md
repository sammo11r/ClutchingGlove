# Clutching Glove
The final goal of this project was to produce a wearable, glove-like object that helps people who are physically impaired with the â€˜gripping' motion of the hand. It was designed to provide strength during the procedure of opening and closing the hand. <br >
With age, the human body loses a lot of its natural strength. This is most noticeable in the hand and fingers. Hence, additional strength in this area could be very beneficial. <br >

The paper explaining the process of constructing the clutching glove, originally written for the course Engineering Design at Eindhoven University of Technology, can be found in `report.pdf`. Moreover, the arduino code used by the clutching glove is present in the `code.ino` file.
