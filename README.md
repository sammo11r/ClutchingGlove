# Clutching Glove
The final goal of this project was to produce a wearable, glove-like object that helps people who are physically impaired with the ‘gripping' motion of the hand. It was designed to provide strength during the procedure of opening and closing the hand. <br >
<br >
At the end of the project, an exoskeleton attached to a glove was produced on a 70 euro budget that provided additional strength to the hand of the user. Tests were executed to analyze the usability of the clutching glove. The results found that the clutching glove’s main use was for somewhat larger, lighter household
objects, say a water bottle or a mug. <br >

The paper explaining the process of constructing the clutching glove, originally written for the course Engineering Design at Eindhoven University of Technology, can be found in `report.pdf`. Moreover, the arduino code used by the clutching glove is present in the `code.ino` file.
